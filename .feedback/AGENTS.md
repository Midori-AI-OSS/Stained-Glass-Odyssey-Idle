# Feedback and Planning

This folder contains task lists, priorities, and planning notes.

## Purpose

The `.feedback/` folder is used for high-level planning, task lists, and project priorities. This is typically managed by project leads and should be considered read-only for most contributors.

## Contents

- Task lists and priorities
- Project planning documents
- Stakeholder feedback
- Feature requests and roadmap items

## Guidelines

- **Read-only for most contributors**: Unless you are the Task Master or project lead, treat these files as informational only
- Task Masters use this folder to identify work that needs to be broken down into actionable tasks in `.codex/tasks/`
- Do not edit files in this folder unless explicitly instructed to do so
- If you need to provide feedback or suggest changes, communicate with the Task Master

## Relationship to Tasks

Planning items in `.feedback/` are converted into concrete tasks in `.codex/tasks/wip/` by the Task Master. The feedback folder maintains the "why" and "what" while tasks specify the "how" and track execution.
