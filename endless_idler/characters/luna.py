When steel is required, the Glimmersteel rapier writes quick, grammatical cuts, the golden quarterstaff sets the tempo and distance, and the Bladeshift dagger ends what hesitation begins. She moves light and economical—cloak skimming stone, angles over brute force—talking just enough to knock an enemy off rhythm. Her magic is moon-cold and precise: starlight darts, gravity tugs, the soft collapse of air before a controlled blast—never wasteful, always aimed at the lever that topples the fight. She isn't a brawler; she's a clockmaker in a storm, turning the right gear until the whole field ticks her way."

    Luna Midori is a compact, finely built woman—5′4″, slender and lightly muscled, with the quiet balance of someone who spends as much time reading as she does walking ruin floors. She’s twenty-eight but reads visually as late-teen to early-twenties: youthful face, open gaze, and a softness around the cheeks that never quite goes away even when she’s exhausted. Her skin is pale with a cool undertone, the sort of porcelain that picks up ambient color—blue from moonlight, amber from candles—and she carries a dusting of light freckles across the bridge of her nose and upper cheeks. Her hands are deft and narrow with long fingers; in study scenes they’re ink-smudged and steady, and in the field they sit high on the hilts at her hips with the easy familiarity of practice.
    Her hair is long and loose, a natural dark green that drifts to lighter, mossy tips—thick enough to frame her features in soft, tousled waves. It’s rarely coiffed: sometimes wind-swept in alleys, sometimes haloed by snow in mountain passes, sometimes pushed back beneath the lip of a hood. The color reads as deep forest indoors and picks up sea-glass highlights under cold light. Beneath that fall of hair, her face is heart-shaped with a small, straight nose and a mobile mouth that lives between rueful smiles and intent concentration. Her eyes are the immediate focal point—large, luminous irises of warm gold that catch pinpricks of whatever light is around: candleflame, glyph-glow, or starlit ceilings. They make her look perpetually awake to wonder, even when she’s grieving or guarded.
    Two constant, unmistakable signatures mark her as otherworldly. First: a faint astral halo—silver-gold, thin as a circlet of light—that hovers above her crown. It’s not theatrical; it sits there like a quiet fact, brightening delicately when she’s spell-focused or prayerful. Second: the Vessel of the Twin Veils, a small orb that floats at her right shoulder, trailed by silver-violet wisps like slow candle smoke. It moves as if it understands her, never crowding, simply keeping station—a companionable star at arm’s length.
    Her default clothing is stark and elegant: a loose black strapless evening dress paired with a flowing black hooded cloak. The dress falls in soft, uncomplicated lines to mid-calf, cinched by a practical belt; the cloak carries most of the silhouette, pooling when she sits and catching a clean rim light when she turns. Boots are sturdy and dark under the hem—made for streets and stone, not ballrooms, even when the dress says otherwise. In cold or travel, the cloak’s hood comes up and the whole figure becomes a small moving constellation of black, pale face, and halo.
    She dresses to context without losing herself. On the road or in study, she slips into a travel-stained beige robe bound with a violet-to-rose sash; the colors are muted but read as scholarly and lived-in. In winter scenes she’s swaddled head-to-toe in a heavier, weathered black cloak, the halo a lone bright ring against snowfall. For city errands, she’s been seen in an off-shoulder dark sweater with fitted brown trousers—a practical “I’m just a person” look that still leaves the staff and sidearm visible. And when ceremony calls, she can step into a midnight-blue, star-flecked suit with cape and gem brooch—sleek tailoring that reframes her as a dignitary of the night sky rather than a traveler beneath it.
    Her gear is consistent and personal. Strapped across her back is a golden quarterstaff tipped with a small crystal that throws prismatic color under the right angle; it’s the quiet spine of her silhouette in almost every frame. At her hips ride a matched pair: the Glimmersteel rapier on the left and the Bladeshift dagger on the right, both sheathed, both worn like familiar tools rather than ornament. In study scenes, a blue-covered spellbook glows softly under her hands—she tends to hover a finger over a line before setting it down, as if negotiating with the text. When she carries keepsakes, they’re intimate and purposeful: an amulet she presses to her palm when the world goes wide, and, in sacred places, the cracked Wandering Bauble—a small sphere that glows like a trapped firefly—set on stone as if entrusted to stand watch.
    Luna’s posture and micro-expressions do as much talking as her clothes. On an arcane lift she stands square to the rising light, one hand on the rail, the other at her collarbone—awed, not cowed. In libraries and attic rooms she leans into pages with the listening stillness of someone who knows magic is a conversation. In streets she centers herself quietly, letting the cloak be her privacy without making a scene. In bad weather she tucks into herself and simply endures, the halo a single bright notation above a line of resolve. Overall she reads as small but not fragile—delicate features wrapped around a core of tensile intent. The sum is unmistakable: a starlit scholar-adventurer, equal parts candlelit study and midnight threshold, built more for precision than spectacle, carrying her light with her rather than waiting for the room to provide it.
