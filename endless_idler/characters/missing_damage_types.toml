# NOTE FOR NEXT AGENT:
# This file tracks character modules that effectively have *no fixed element/damage type*.
# Criteria for inclusion:
# - No `damage_type` declared, OR
# - `damage_type` is randomized (e.g. choice(ALL_DAMAGE_TYPES)).
#
# Please implement the requested damage type in the referenced character class/module, then remove the entry.
# Valid damage types (currently): fire, ice, wind, lightning, light, dark, generic.
