# Lore Documentation

This folder contains game lore, narrative content, and story planning for Stained Glass Odyssey Idle.

## Purpose

The `.codex/lore/` folder holds all narrative and story-related documentation for the game, including character backgrounds, world-building notes, and story planning.

## Directory Structure

- **`notes/`** - Detailed lore notes, character backgrounds, world-building details
- **`planning/`** - Story arcs, narrative outlines, unresolved questions

## Contents

### Notes
- Character backstories and motivations
- World lore and history
- Location descriptions
- Item and artifact lore
- Cultural and social structures
- Timeline and chronology

### Planning
- Story arc outlines
- Narrative progression plans
- Character development arcs
- Unresolved lore questions
- Future content ideas

## Guidelines for Storytellers

- Document all lore discussions and clarifications in `notes/`
- Keep story planning and outlines in `planning/`
- Never invent new lore without explicit approval from the lead developer
- Ask clarifying questions before documenting new concepts
- Maintain consistency with existing lore across all documents
- Update the storyteller cheat sheet in `.codex/notes/` regularly

## Stained Glass Universe

Stained Glass Odyssey Idle is set in the shared Stained Glass universe. When creating or documenting lore:
- Maintain consistency with other Stained Glass games
- Respect established character personalities and backgrounds
- Follow the visual and narrative style of the stained glass aesthetic
- Coordinate with other projects when introducing shared characters

## Relationship to Implementation

Lore documentation should inform but not duplicate implementation details:
- Technical game mechanics are documented in `.codex/implementation/`
- Lore provides the narrative "why" while implementation provides the mechanical "how"
- Character abilities should have both lore explanations (here) and mechanical descriptions (in implementation docs)
