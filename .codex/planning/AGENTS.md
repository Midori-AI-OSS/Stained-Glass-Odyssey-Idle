# Planning Documentation

This folder contains project planning documents and strategic notes.

## Purpose

The `.codex/planning/` folder holds high-level planning documents, architectural decisions, and strategic direction for the project.

## Contents

- Architectural decision records (ADRs)
- Feature planning documents
- Technical roadmaps
- System design documents
- Integration plans
- Migration strategies

## Guidelines

- **Read-only for most contributors**: Unless you are the Task Master, Manager, or lead developer, treat these files as informational only
- Planning documents inform task creation but are not tasks themselves
- Keep planning documents up to date as decisions are made
- Document the "why" behind major decisions
- Link to related tasks and implementation docs

## Relationship to Other Folders

- **`.feedback/`**: Strategic priorities that inform planning
- **`.codex/planning/`**: Detailed technical plans (this folder)
- **`.codex/tasks/`**: Concrete work items that implement plans
- **`.codex/implementation/`**: Documentation of completed implementations
