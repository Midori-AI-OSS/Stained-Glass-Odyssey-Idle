# Stained Glass Odyssey Idle - Implementation Documentation

This folder contains technical documentation for the game's implementation.

## Purpose

The `.codex/implementation/` folder holds technical documentation that describes how various systems and features are implemented in the game. This documentation should be kept in sync with code changes.

## Documentation Standards

- Use markdown format for all documentation
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes
- Include code examples where relevant
- Document APIs, interfaces, and system architectures
- Explain design decisions and rationales

## Topics to Document

As the game is developed, create documentation files for:

- **Game Mechanics**: Resource systems, progression mechanics, idle mechanics
- **Character System**: Character data structures, abilities, progression
- **Save System**: Save/load functionality, data persistence
- **UI System**: User interface components and interactions
- **Asset Management**: How assets are loaded and managed
- **Event System**: Game events and callbacks
- **Balance**: Game balance considerations and calculations

## Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens for file names (e.g., `game-mechanics.md`)
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the content
- Group related documentation in subdirectories if needed

## Updating Documentation

When making code changes:
1. Update existing documentation to reflect changes
2. Create new documentation for new systems
3. Remove documentation for deprecated features
4. Keep examples and code snippets current
