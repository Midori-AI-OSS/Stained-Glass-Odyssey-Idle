# Stained Glass Odyssey Idle - Instructions

This folder contains process documentation and contributor guidelines.

## Purpose

The `.codex/instructions/` folder holds process notes, workflow guidelines, and contributor instructions that help maintain consistency across the project.

## Documentation Standards

- Use markdown format for all documentation
- Keep instructions clear and actionable
- Update when processes change
- Include examples where helpful

## Topics to Document

As development processes are established, create instruction files for:

- **Development Workflow**: How to set up, develop, test, and deploy
- **Testing Standards**: How to write and run tests
- **Code Review Process**: Guidelines for reviewing code
- **Documentation Standards**: How to write and maintain documentation
- **Git Workflow**: Branching, committing, and merging practices
- **Release Process**: How releases are prepared and deployed
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

## Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens for file names (e.g., `development-workflow.md`)
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the content
- Group related instructions in subdirectories if needed

## Updating Instructions

When processes change:
1. Update existing instructions to reflect new processes
2. Create new instructions for new workflows
3. Archive outdated instructions rather than deleting them
4. Keep all examples current and tested
